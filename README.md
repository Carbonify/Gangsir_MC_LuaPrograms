# Minecraft Lua Programs
A repository of all the lua programs i've written for the OpenComputers and Computercraft mods for Minecraft.

All of these are mine, however some use APIs written by others. The needed APIs can be found in comments of the program in question.

If you use any of these programs, please follow the MIT license and give credit. Also feel free to modify my programs for *personal use.*
